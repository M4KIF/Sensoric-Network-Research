# Sensoric-Network-Research
The purpose is to have a framework ready to test out how different algorithms can improve the life expectancy of a WSN.

Using modules such as:
- PyQt // GUI and threading
- shapely // Node localization, area calculations
- matplotlib // Displaying of the WSN

I do not own the rights to the articles nor did I created them. They are used as refferences and for citing in the thesis document. All of the rights to those papers are the property of their authors and supervisors
